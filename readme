Ok guys this unfortunately takes a bit of configuration but I was able to get it working. Here are the steps:

Step 0: Installing Python - probably don't need to do anything
	Should come pre-installed on OSX with version 2.6.1, which is what I'm using.


I. Installing PyDev for Eclipse

See Manual: http://pydev.org/manual_101_root.html

The easiest way is to have Eclipse install it for you by opening Eclipse and going to 
Help > Install New Software. For instructions go to (http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html#id4) and follow
the part titled "Installing with the update site".




II. Installing Numberjack - the painful part

If you guys are running some version of OSX or linux this will work. For Windows you'd need Cygwin or PuTTy too.

Download the zip from http://4c110.ucc.ie/numberjack/download and extract it.

Navigate to your newly extracted directory in terminal and type the commands:
	sudo bash
	export ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'
	make install
	export PYTHONPATH=/home/<your user name>/<path to numberjack>/numberjack.0.1.10-11-24/local_lib:$PYTHONPATH
	export PATH=/home/<your user name>/<path to numberjack>/numberjack.0.1.10-11-24/local_lib:$PATH
	
The last two may be unnecessary but they won't hurt. I ran into more problems than normal because of the way
my environment was configured, but hopefully the above will work for you guys. If not let me know, cause
I may have run into the same problems.

Now we have to add this to our System's PYTHONPATH in Eclipse.

1. Open Eclipse and go to preferences
2. Expand 'PyDev' in the list on the left
3. Select 'Interpreter - Python'
4. Click on "New Folder"
5. Click "Macintosh HD" in the finder window and navigate to "/Library/Python/2.X/site-packages" and hit ok
6. Make sure you now have "/Library/Python/2.X/site-packages" in the list of System libs... this should cover
your Numberjack install, which installs by default to that directory





III. Installing git (if you don't already have it)

Download the OSX installer here: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3
You probably want the one at the top of the list.
If you're running linux instead of OSX look at this page: http://book.git-scm.com/2_installing_git.html





IV. Getting the project from the repository

I set up a public github project at https://github.com/hosemagi/CS175Project.

To get the project:

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to your Documents/Eclipse/Workspace directory
3. Type the following command:
	git clone git@github.com:hosemagi/CS175Project.git .
	
	This should copy all the files from the repository into a folder called CS175Project into your eclipse workspace.
4. Open Eclipse and go to File > Import
5. Open the "General" folder and select "Existing Projects into Workspace"
6. Next to where it has the field for "Select root directory:" hit browse and browse to 
	/Documents/Eclipse/Workspace/CS175Project
7. Hit Finish
8. Try running main.py. If it works you're up and running!

If you haven't used git before, it's just like CVS/SVN except super easy. I wouldn't bother trying to integrate
it into Eclipse, it's easy enough to use from the command line. The basics are:

After you edit a file, create a file, delete a file, or make any change in general... navigate to the CS175Project
directory in your terminal and:
	git add .
	git commit -m 'your commit message'
	git push
	
To update to the latest version on the repo, just:
	git pull
	
Here's a good git crash course with tons of info that should be understandable if you've used SVN before:
